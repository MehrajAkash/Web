    <p class="paragraph-style"> A paragraph is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. Though not required by the orthographic conventions of any language with a writing system, 
        <br/> paragraphs are a conventional means of organizing extended segments of prose.</p>
 
     <p class="paragraph-style">A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic.
         <br/> Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.</p>
