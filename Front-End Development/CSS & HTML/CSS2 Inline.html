    <p style="color:green; font-size: 25px"> A paragraph is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. Though not required by the orthographic conventions of any language with a writing system, 
       <br/> paragraphs are a conventional means of organizing extended segments of prose.</p>

    <p style="color:blueviolet; font-size: 30px; font-weight: 100">A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic.
        <br/> Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.</p>
